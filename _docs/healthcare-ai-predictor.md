# healthcare ai predictor

## project overview

a modern healthcare analytics platform showcasing predictive modeling for hospital operations with real-time inference capabilities. focuses on hospital length-of-stay prediction as a proxy for bed demand forecasting, with extensible architecture for additional healthcare prediction tasks.

## core objectives

- **predictive modeling**: develop accurate length-of-stay predictions using modern ml techniques
- **real-time inference**: provide instant predictions through clean web interface
- **data exploration**: enable natural language querying of healthcare datasets using llm integration
- **production readiness**: demonstrate scalable, maintainable code patterns suitable for healthcare environments
- **interpretability**: provide explainable ai outputs for clinical decision support

## value proposition

healthcare systems need accurate operational forecasting to optimize resource allocation. this project demonstrates:
- modern python data stack proficiency (polars, uv ecosystem)
- production ml pipeline design
- healthcare domain understanding
- real-time system architecture
- ai safety and interpretability considerations

## target outcomes

1. **working application**: deployed web app with prediction interface
2. **model performance**: demonstrate competitive accuracy on healthcare predictions
3. **code quality**: production-grade codebase with proper documentation
4. **innovation showcase**: integrate cutting-edge features (llm querying, real-time updates)
5. **portfolio asset**: reusable foundation for future healthcare ai projects

## differentiation factors

- **modern tech stack**: uv, polars, pnpm - showcasing latest ecosystem tools
- **real-time capabilities**: live prediction interface, not batch processing demo
- **llm integration**: natural language data exploration without over-engineering
- **finnish context**: subtle healthcare system awareness without being obvious
- **production patterns**: proper error handling, logging, monitoring considerations

## success metrics

- **functionality**: all core features working smoothly
- **performance**: sub-second prediction response times
- **code quality**: passes all linting, proper documentation
- **user experience**: intuitive interface, clear visualizations
- **technical depth**: demonstrates understanding of healthcare ai challenges

## future extensibility

designed as foundation for:
- additional prediction models (readmission risk, mortality prediction)
- multi-language support (finnish/english healthcare terminology)
- integration with hospital information systems
- regulatory compliance features (gdpr, eu ai act)
- advanced analytics dashboards
