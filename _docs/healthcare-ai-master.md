### development phases
1. **setup & eda** (1.5h): environment, data exploration
2. **ml pipeline** (2h): model training, api development
3. **frontend** (1.5h): ui components, real-time features
4. **deployment** (1h): docker, azure deployment

## development guidelines

### code quality standards
- all python code must pass ruff linting
- comprehensive docstrings using google convention
- typescript strict mode throughout frontend
- proper error handling and logging
- unit tests for critical ml pipeline components

### healthcare-specific considerations
- synthetic data only for development/demo
- gdpr compliance patterns for production readiness
- model interpretability for clinical acceptance
- temporal data splits to avoid leakage
- healthcare domain terminology awareness

### performance targets (actual vs achieved)
- prediction latency: <500ms ‚úÖ (~200ms achieved)
- model loading: <2 seconds ‚úÖ (~500ms achieved)
- prediction accuracy: rmse <2.0 days ‚ö†Ô∏è (~2.1 days achieved)
- model r¬≤: >0.5 ‚ö†Ô∏è (0.424 achieved with synthetic data)
- frontend responsiveness: <100ms interactions ‚úÖ

## getting started

1. **read project overview**: start with [[healthcare-ai-predictor]] for context
2. **understand architecture**: review [[healthcare-ai-architecture]] for technical depth  
3. **follow implementation**: use [[healthcare-ai-implementation]] as development guide
4. **prepare data**: reference [[healthcare-ai-dataset]] for data pipeline setup

## project context

this project serves as both a technical showcase and practical foundation for healthcare ai applications. while designed as a portfolio piece, it follows production-ready patterns that could scale to real healthcare environments.

the codebase emphasizes:
- modern python ecosystem tools (uv, polars, ruff)
- clean architecture with proper separation of concerns
- healthcare domain awareness and compliance considerations
- real-time capabilities and user-centered design
- reusable patterns for future projects

## implementation learnings & next steps

### what worked exceptionally well ‚úÖ
- **modern python tooling**: uv, polars, fastapi created excellent dx  
- **synthetic data strategy**: enabled rapid prototyping without data access issues
- **xgboost performance**: excellent for tabular data, ensemble methods unnecessary
- **polars integration**: superior to pandas for data processing
- **overfitting control**: achieved minimal gap (0.065) through proper regularization

### what needs improvement ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **model performance**: synthetic data limited final performance (r¬≤=0.424)  
- **real dataset**: need clinical lab values for better predictions
- **feature engineering**: lab ratios and clinical thresholds needed
- **temporal validation**: implement proper healthcare time-series splits

### immediate next session priorities üéØ
1. **integrate real kaggle dataset** (100K records with clinical lab values)
2. **expect major performance gains**: targeting r¬≤>0.6, rmse<1.5 days  
3. **clinical feature engineering**: lab ratios, medical thresholds
4. **deploy improved model** to production api

### future development (post real-data integration)
- consider extending to multiple prediction types (readmission, mortality)
- explore integration with finnish healthcare terminology  
- evaluate multi-language support for international use
- investigate federated learning for multi-hospital deployments
- plan for regulatory compliance automation (eu ai act)
